# Bootstrap-Responsive-Table
Hello, This is a new one, I had used CSS to create tables before and then Got suggestion that it is going to impact the rendering. So as an alternative I had to switch to Bootstrap table which is developed using div tags primarily and is also made responsive say width from 150% 

If you would want to edit and use the tables. Please feel free to do so 

There are two versions 

1. With SASS stored in src folder 
2. With CSS stored in dist folder
